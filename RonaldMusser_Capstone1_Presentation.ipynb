    "In order to predict which teams will succeed in making the playoffs, it was necessary to figure out which stats best correlated with a playoff birth. To do this, each team was ranked from highest to lowest for each individual stat. The amount of teams in the top 16 were tallied and then divided by 16. This created a correlation factor for each statistic that shows how indicative it is at predicting a playoff birth for that season. The top 5 correlation factors were then plotted. This process was repeated for each year, from 1984 to 2006."

    "\n",
    "As you can see, the correlation factors seem to be decreasing as the years go by. From 1984 to 2000 to 2016, it would seem that the league is becoming more difficult to predict. The reason for this is quite simplly due to the number of teams increasing over the years. While the top 16 teams always make the playoffs, the number of teams that don't has steadily increased. In 1984, only 7 teams did not make the playoffs (23 total teams). By 2000, 13 teams did not make the playoffs (29 teams). Currently, there are 30 teams in the league. Therefore, 14 of them miss out on the playoffs.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "By themselves, these statistics are useful but not exactly what is needed. Comparing the correlation factors over time is necessary to create a predictive model for the three most recent seasons. The factors must be compared on equal ground. In order to do this, a weighting function must be introduced. Since the teams that don't make the playoffs is the changing variable, the weighting function will be based on that. Therefore, each correlation factor will be multiplied by a fraction of the number of teams that missed the playoffs that particular year by the current number of teams that miss the playoffs. Thus, the weighting factor for 1984, 2000, and 2016 are 7/14, 13/14, and 14/14 (1) respectively. Adding this weighting function shows a more consistant top 5 correlation factors throughout the years.  "

A team's field goal defense (OP-FG Miss%), number of assists (AST), three point percentage (3P%), and field goal percentage (FG%) are also factors that contribute to a teams success. Thus, we have found the answer to our first question. However, it is obvious that the league changes as the years go by.

In fact, most of the statistics across the board have decreased by more than 5% since 1984.

These 6 factors that are either the most correlated, increasing in correlation over time, or both can now be used to predict a team's playoff birth.

Each factor adds a certain value based on how well they are doing against the league average. This value is also weighted based on the average correlation factor of that statistic. Thus, a team's win percentage is more important than their three point percentage. The 16 teams with the highest scoring factor are the predicted playoff teams. An error is then calculated from the amount of teams that were predicted to have a playoff birth but ended up missing out. This process is repeated for the 2018 and 2019 seasons and the error is posted below."

    "While this model has fairly high accuracy, there could be possible ways to increase its predictive power. One such method would be to split the teams into their conferences and conduct the analysis separately. Although 16 teams make the playoffs, it is not necessary always the top 16 overall. The league has two conferences and takes the top 8 from each. If one conference is much stronger than the other, this can create errors within the predictions. This separation can help protect the model from such imbalances within the league. Another improvement would take into account injuries that severely impacts a team. A superstar being injured at the beginning of a season but returning later would not be taken into account by this model. The same goes for a superstar who was injured right after the month of November. Each scenario would create a skewed prediction that would most likely be incorrect."
